# Introduction : 
Car glass that is exposed to dirt or rainwater will usually be cleaned using a wiper. usually, the wiper is attached to the front and rear sides with the wiper, the driver's view will not be hindered and so they can see clearly towards the front or rear.Existing system manually used control stalk to activate wiper and the process of pulling up wiper is difficult to be handled.Whenever the water hit a dedicated sensor that located on windscreen, it will send a signal to move on the wiper motor.Once water is not detected by sensor, the wiper will automatically stop. This will help the driver to give more concentration and reduce the car accident probability.
# Features:
1.It shall lock the car when the button is pressed once.
2.It shall open the car when the button is pressed twice.
3.It shall wiper on and it moves clock wise direction and when the button is pressed thrice.
4.It shall wiper off and it moves anti clock wise direction and when the button is pressed four times.
5.It shall wiper complete one cycle when the button is pressed five times.
